# drf-guard

Flexible and simple to use permissions for Django REST Framework

## Getting started

```py
# views.py

from rest_framework import viewsets

# Import operators & permissions from drf_guard
from drf_guard.operators import And, Or, Not
from drf_guard.permissions import HasRequiredGroups, HasRequiredPermissions

class UserViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
    queryset = User.objects.all()
    serializer_class = UserSerializer
    
    # Use drf_guard permissions here
    permission_classes = (HasRequiredGroups, HasRequiredPermissions)
    
    # Now guard your API as you wish
    groups_and_permissions = {
         'GET': {
             'list': {
                 # To access this the user should belongs to admin or client group
                 'groups': ['admin', Or, 'client'],
                 'permissions': [IsAuthenticated]  # Also the user should be authenticated
             },
             'retrieve': {
                 'groups': [Not 'admin'],  # The user should not be in admin group
                 'permissions': [IsAuthenticated, And, IsAllowedUser]  # Should be authenticated and allowed
             },
         },
         'PUT': {
             'groups': ['__all__'],  # Belongs to any group
             'permissions': [IsAuthenticated, And, IsAdmin]  # By now this should be obvious
         },
         'PATCH': {
             'groups': ['client', And, Not 'admin'],  # User belongs to client and not admin group
             'permissions': [IsAuthenticated, IsAllowedUser]  # This is = [IsAuthenticated, And, IsAllowedUser]
         },
         'DELETE': {
             'groups': ['client', Or, [Not 'client', And, 'admin']],  # You can basically do any combination
             'permissions': [IsAuthenticated]
         }
    }
```

What's important here is to know what goes into groups and permission
- Groups takes group names and Django group objects, so you can use those operators however you want with these two
- Permissions takes DRF permissions(class based), Django permission objects and Django permission names, so you can use those operators however you want with these three

Note:
- And, Or & Not are the equvalent operators for and, or & not 
- The '__all__' on groups stands for any group(or allow all groups)
- The GET-list stands for permission & groups in `GET: /user/` route
- The GET-retrieve stands for groups & permissions in `GET: /user/{id}/` routes
- The POST stands for groups & permissions in `POST: /user/` route
- The PUT stands for groups & permissions in `PUT: /user/{id}/` routes
- The PATCH stands for groups & permissions in `PATCH: /user/{id}/` routes
- The DELETE stands for groups & permissions in `DELETE: /user/{id}/` routes
